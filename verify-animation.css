/* File to verify the typing animation CSS */
/*
This demonstrates the typing animation that should work:

.typing-dot {
  animation: typing-dot 1.4s infinite ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes typing-dot {
  0%, 60%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 0.4;
  }
  30% {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.typing-dot:nth-child(2) {
  animation-delay: 0.2s;
}

.typing-dot:nth-child(3) {
  animation-delay: 0.4s;
}

Expected behavior:
- All 3 dots should bounce up and down
- Each dot should start at different times (staggered)
- Animation duration: 1.4s per cycle
- Dots should move from Y=0 to Y=-10px and back
- Opacity should change from 0.4 to 1 during bounce
